function [spikeTrainPos, spikeTrainNeg, filteredData, threshold, timeInterval] = detectSpikes_Tommy(data, method, multiplier, fs, voidPeriod_ms, frequencyRange, sType)

% input 
    % data: a n x 1 vector containing the signal, where n is the number of
    % samples 
    % method: string value specifying the spike detection method to use 
    % multiplier: the threshold multiplier to use for your chosen method 
    % L: loss parameter for wavelet method, won't matter if other methods
    % used. Default is zero as recommended by the creator.

%% Rich's Spike Detection Procedure 

% This is functionally the same as Manuel's method, however, the median
% rather than the mean of the data is used when creating the threshold.
% Although somewhat subtle, this approach avoids an unnecessarily decreased
% (more negative) threshold when there is a high frequency of
% large-amplitude spikes in the recording. 

% A threshold multiplier of 5 is still recomended. However, a decreased
% refractory period, below the 2 ms used in the Schroter et al., 2015
% paper, has been shown to decrease the number of false negatives in 
% recording traces. That is, if you wish to consider that data are infact
% representative of MUA; a 2 ms refractory period somewhat biases detected 
% spikes to be considered as SUA. That being said, either the multiplier or
% imposed refractory period should be changed in the main script rather
% than this funtion.
% I have just changed the method name to Tommy temporarily, but it is
% largely still Rich's work. I intent to remove 'method' references to
% clean up at some point

%% General paramters


%% 
if strcmp(method,'Tommy') % only do the filtering and fs adjustment i
    
    % Create Butterworth Filter and Apply it to MEA Data
    % Dhyrfjeld-Johnson, 2010 uses 1-100Hz to get rid of fast ripples, when
    % this is used I encounter "Warning: Matrix is close to singular or
    % badly scaled. Results may be inaccurate" but not with 500Hz
    % Zhang, 2021 used 2-500Hz when plotting, noting were embedded in fast ripples
    % For now will use 200Hz as suggested by Tanja but can be looked into
    % further

    %% Create Threshold for Channel
    
    m = mean(filteredData); % Finds mean of filtered recording data. Note that filteredData is from one channel, indexed in the batchGestSpike.m function. 
    s = std(filteredData); % more robust and proper
    

    %% find negative deflections
    
    
    thresholdNegative = m - multiplier*s; % Creates threshold for fliltered data. The multiplier can be changed in the main script.
   

    if ~strcmp(method,'noise') && strcmp(sType, 'mu')

        end
    end


    % Create Preliminary Binary Spike Train
    
    spikeTrainNeg = filteredData < thresholdNegative; % Removes data more positive than negative threshold.
