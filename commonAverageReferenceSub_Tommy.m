function [data] = commonAverageReferenceSub_Tommy(data, neglectGroupRemoval, noisyChannels)
% this basically adds a reference electrode for each group equal to the
% mean of the signal from the other group. Allows thus for the removal of
% all-channel noise such as mechanical disturbance or pump action, without
% reducing the amplitude of spike signals which are often concurrent in the
% same groups

%% select the common average to use
% can't simply use red average to subtract from black and vice versa
% because if one has high amplitude spikes and the other doesnt this will
% put antipolar spikes in the non-spiking group which will get picked up
% and confuse things due to use of both positive and negative thresholds
% if one channel is spikier than all others its correlation with B/R/N will
% be lower thus the highest correlation indicates the
% not-most-likely-to-confound common average

% if BxR > BxN && BxR > RxN
%     commonAverage = (commonAverageBlack*24 + commonAverageRed*21)/45; % if R and B are most highly correlated then commonAverage taken as a weighted mean of the two of them. Consider using n as the common average but as this tends to be noisier I'm uncertain of if would be wise
% elseif BxN > BxR && BxN > RxN
%     commonAverage = commonAverageBlack; % if black and n correlate the best it implies R has a particularly different waveform thus should not be used for common average as explained above
