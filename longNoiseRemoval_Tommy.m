function [spikeMatrixPos, spikeMatrixNeg, checkLP] = longNoiseRemoval_Tommy(spikeMatrixPos, spikeMatrixNeg, fs, filteredData, maxL)

% removes any events which spend an unreasonable amount to time above
% threshold suggesting it is a noise event rather than a spike
% note although 'matrix' is used this is really dealing with each channel
% at a time
checkLP = 0; %legacy
%% positive first

%c = 0.3*fs; % cutoff length, 300ms empirically so far - some papers suggest much larger but these are for EEG. remember fs = 1s
c = maxL;
% Staley, 2012 refers to IIS as <250ms
% Ratnadurai-Giridharan, 2014 refers as <400ms
% remember i am reffering only to the initial upshot
% higher cutoff selected for now to preserve as many spikes as possible
% however as I am only recording detecting between when it is above
% threshold could potentially make smaller, or else change it so I detect
% the length of each spike from isoelectric - seems excessive effort though
